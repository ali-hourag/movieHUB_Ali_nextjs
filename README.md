## About

MovieHUB project done by me, Ali Hourag, implementing specially Next.js.
<br/>
In this app a user can add his/her favourite movies, edit and remove them.
<br/>
This project is refactored from <a href="https://github.com/ali-hourag/moviehub_ali">this one.</a>
<br/>
* Connection to database.
* Use of Auth0 for authentication.
* Use of Cloudinary to upload images.


## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- TypeScript
- Next.js
- Auth0.
- Cloudinary.


## Setup
If you want run it directly from code do it by opening the project on Visual Studio Code and on terminal: npm run dev
<br/>
However, before that, the database should be running to ensure the correct use of the app. To run server:
<br/>
* Clone this <a href="https://github.com/ali-hourag/moviehub_ali">project</a> > on terminal: cd server > npm run dev
<br /> That is the original React project, that is why the database is in there.
<br/>
It is important to know that it is optimised for mobile devices, so it is recommended to open the inspector and select the mobile device!
